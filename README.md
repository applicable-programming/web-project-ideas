<p align="center">Framework for coming up with ideas for your next project
<br /> (for cv, portfolio, startup...)</p>


# About the framework

Sometimes it is difficult to come up with an idea for our next project. Whether we want to learn new technology, improve our CV and portfolio, or maybe just start a new hobby or even a business. 
Video instruction here :


 


# Getting Started

## 1. Choose Topic
Pick something you are interested in. This will keep you motivated during the hard times (and there will be hard times, especially if you are learning). 

| Topic |
|:---:|
| photography |
| reading |
| sport (football, tennis, training) |
| video games |
| movies |
| cars |
| travel |
| collecting things |
| fishing |
| any hobby from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies)|

## 2. Choose Service
This will give your project a meaning, something that you and perhaps others could use in the real life

|Examples of services|
|:---:|
| catalogs and data trackers/logs |
| planners and reminders <br /> (but NOT a todo) |
| project management tools |
| calculators and converters |
| social interaction |
| motivational services |
| accessibility services |


## 3. Choose Technology
This will give the meaning to your hard work, especially if you are learning. You will be able to measure your progress in some area, and also know what you should learn next. Some areas might make sense, some not. For example, if you are learning for frontend, then focus on that, but at least learn some basics of backend (or other areas).  

|Technology| details |
|:---:| :---:|
| Css and HTML | to a desired level |
| JavaScript | always relevant to some level |
| Frontend and/or Backend language | oop concepts, design patterns, s.o.l.i.d.,  automated testing... |
| Database and storage | CRUD, relations, normalization, logging in files, files and images manipulation...|
| api integration | google maps, eBay, Wikipedia, google books, amazon, your own service...|
| data manipulation | calculation, conversion |
| security | best practices, protection, common problems |
| authorization and authentication | local or external (auth0, google, facebook, custom...)
|package management|npm, yarn, composer|
|mobile applications|native, flutter, ionic|

## 4. Now make it
Combine some or several of the things above, and try to come up with something that will be useful, and also something where you will learn whatever you want to learn.
Imagine meeting your favourite developer/investor/mentor, and he asks you: 
- What are you working on (and why)?
- What technologies are you using (and why)?
- What is your goal (and why)?
- What have you learned (and why)?
- What you liked most (and why)?
- What is the most difficult thing (and why)?

If you start with your project, and after a month you can answer these questions from above, you are ready for an interview with a company that uses the technology you are learning.
